      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <h4>
        Hi, I'm Adrianna Helfrich! I'm a software engineer based in New York
        City. With a background in graphic design, I transitioned to software
        engineering, completing Hack Reactor's Full Stack Engineering bootcamp.
        I excel at developing features from the ground up, leveraging my skills
        in both the technical and design aspects. Coming from a non-traditional
        path, I've cultivated a strong sense of vigilance and self-motivation,
        which I believe sets me apart in the industry. I'm proficient in
        JavaScript/Typescript and Python as well as various other technologies
        and frameworks. I'm excited about the constant learning opportunities in
        software engineering and always ready to learn something new!
