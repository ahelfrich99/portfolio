        I'm Adrianna Helfrich! I'm a full-stack software engineer based in the
        Bay Area. Though my background is in design, I recently completed Hack
        Reactor's software engineering coding bootcamp and am searching for my
        first job as a developer. Feel free to check out my projects on my
        Gitlab, or take a look at my resume!
